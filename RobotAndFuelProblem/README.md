# Robot And Fuel Problem

There are N cars parked in a row in a parking lot of the newly  constructed club.

There is a gasoline and diesel fueling station installed at the left and right side of the park.

An automatic fueling robot  carries the fuel from station and fill up the parked car with fuel. The cars are divided into 2 types depending on whether it is a gasoline or diesel car.
1 is denoted as gasoline cars and 2 is denoted as diesel cars.

The automatic robot will be used to provide a cost free fueling service which is filling up all cars with 1 litre of each corresponding fuel.

The robot will move in between the 2 fuelling stations as below :

1) The robot carries 2 litre of gasoline at the gasoline station and starts moving from there.

2) The robot can fill up the cars of the same type of gas it carries 1 litre each.

3) The robot can go back to the fuelling station at any time, Independent from the current amount of fuel it carries.

4) When the robot arrives at the fuelling station, it gets 2 litre of supply of the corresponding fuel.(If the robot has some remaining fuel it will be discarded).

5) There is an equal distance of 1 between each fueling station and the cars.

The fuel type of N Cars parked in the parking lot will be given.
Find the minimum moving distance of the automated fueling robot after it has filled up all the cars with 1 litre  of fuel each.
