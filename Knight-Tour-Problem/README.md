# The Knight’s Tour Problem
<p>Another classic problem that can be used to illustrate a second common graph algorithm is called the “knight’s tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The object of the puzzle is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once. One such sequence is called a “tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle has fascinated chess players, mathematicians and computer scientists alike for many years. The upper bound on the number of possible legal tours for an eight-by-eight chessboard is known to be 1.305×1035; however, there are even more possible dead ends. Clearly this is a problem that requires some real brains, some real computing power, or both.</p>

<p>Although researchers have studied many different algorithms to solve the knight’s tour problem, a graph search is one of the easiest to understand and program.</p>
